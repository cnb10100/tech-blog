# Tech-Blog

## Description

This is a project which I developed for the Bootcamp Course with the University of Toronto. The application inside this repository is a CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish articles, blog posts, and their thoughts and opinions. Users can also interact with other users posts, leaving comments. I used the MVC paradigm to construct this application, and handlebars as the template engine. Sequelize was used as the ORM, and the express-session package was used for authentication.

## Usage

Clone the repository, then navigate to the root folder. Once there, use the CLI to run the following commands:

Seed DB: 
npm run seed

Start Server: 
npm start server
